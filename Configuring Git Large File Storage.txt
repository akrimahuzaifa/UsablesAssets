1. Open Git Bash.

2. Change your current working directory to an existing repository you'd like to use with Git LFS.

3. To associate a file type in your repository with Git LFS, enter git lfs track followed by the name of the file extension you want to automatically upload to Git LFS.

For example, to associate a .psd file, enter the following command:

$ git lfs track "*.psd"
> Adding path *.psd


4. Add a file to the repository matching the extension you've associated:

$ git add path/to/file.psd



5. Commit the file and push it to GitHub:

$ git commit -m "add file.psd"
$ git push
